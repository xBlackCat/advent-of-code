/**
 * --- Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory ---
 * With the toboggan login problems resolved, you set off toward the airport".", While travel by toboggan might be easy, it's certainly not safe: there's very minimal steering and the area is covered in trees".", You'll need to see which angles will take you near the fewest trees".",
 * <p>
 * Due to the local geology, trees in this area only grow on exact integer coordinates in a grid".", You make a map (your puzzle input) of the open squares (".",) and trees ("#",) you can see".", For example:
 * <p>
 * "..##.......",
 * "#...#...#..",
 * ".#....#..#.",
 * "..#.#...#.#",
 * ".#...##..#.",
 * "..#.##.....",
 * ".#.#.#....#",
 * ".#........#",
 * "#.##...#...",
 * "#...##....#",
 * ".#..#...#.#",
 * These aren't the only trees, though; due to something you read about once involving arboreal genetics and biome stability, the same pattern repeats to the right many times:
 * <p>
 * "..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......",  --->
 * "#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..",
 * ".#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.",
 * "..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#",
 * ".#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.",
 * "..#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....",  --->
 * ".#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#",
 * ".#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#",
 * "#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...",
 * "#...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....#",
 * ".#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#",  --->
 * You start on the open square (".",) in the top-left corner and need to reach the bottom (below the bottom-most row on your map)".",
 * <p>
 * The toboggan can only follow a few specific slopes (you opted for a cheaper model that prefers rational numbers); start by counting all the trees you would encounter for the slope right 3, down 1:
 * <p>
 * From your starting position at the top-left, check the position that is right 3 and down 1".", Then, check the position that is right 3 and down 1 from there, and so on until you go past the bottom of the map".",
 * <p>
 * The locations you'd check in the above example are marked here with O where there was an open square and X where there was a tree:
 * <p>
 * "..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......",  --->
 * "#..",O"#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..",
 * ".#....",X"..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.",
 * "..#.#...#",O"#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#",
 * ".#...##..#..",X"...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.",
 * "..#.##.......#.",X"#.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....",  --->
 * ".#.#.#....#.#.#.#.",O"..#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#",
 * ".#........#.#........",X".#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#",
 * "#.##...#...#.##...#...#.",X"#...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...",
 * "#...##....##...##....##...#",X"....##...##....##...##....##...##....#",
 * ".#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...",X".#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#",  --->
 * In this example, traversing the map using this slope would cause you to encounter 7 trees".",
 * <p>
 * Starting at the top-left corner of your map and following a slope of right 3 and down 1, how many trees would you encounter?
